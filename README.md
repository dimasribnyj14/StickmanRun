This is first version of remote repositories but this is second version of local repositories.
You can download this zip, you can modify, play and more.
This is my first remote repositories in my life.
# Story
Stickman after another day of work goes home without wearing an umbrella,
thinking that it will not rain and not seeing blood in the window,
he went into the house and saw a corpse in his house and it turned out to be his brother,
the stickman was shocked and wanted to know who did it, but without hesitation,
the police had already arrived and they might have thought that you killed your brother and are trying to escape and you even manage to escape,
but the police saw your tracks and began to search and the stickman had to run away from the police until he proved that he was not a killer.
# Gameplay
You are a stickman and you can walk, run, jump but when you run, the police smell and look for the best.
With each chapter, you find a new adventure and the further you remain on the wanted list, the harder it is to hide from the police.
When you are caught, you can say bye and have to start over, but the save works when you exit the game.
